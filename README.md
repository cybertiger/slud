## About

I've done this before, I'm an expert, trust me.

This is about my 5th attempt at creating a mudclient, the architecture is
solid, however the code quality at this time is pretty poor.

Will clean up the code at some point later when it starts to become to hard
to fix anything without breaking something else.
